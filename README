AutocompleterServer
===================

=== What is it? ===
A flexible prototype/scriptaculous autocompleter JSON API designed to integrate with the autocompleter_client plugin.

=== What it does? ===
  - Injects functionality into Routes, Models, Views, and Controllers necessary for autocompleter client's to function.

  - Centralizes all configuration associated with autocompleter operation through the app to an initializer file.

=== Install ===
  - git clone autocompleter_server into vendor/plugins

  - script/generate autocompleter_server
      produces => config/initializers/autocompleter_server.rb

  - Register the resources inside the initializer in the above file.
     -- This will require:
         - An ActiveRecord Model.
         - A Controller to expose said model.

  - The example code is in config/initializers/autocompleter_server.rb
    Go there.

=== Integration with AutocompleterClient ===
  - run `rake routes`

  - find the ones called autocompleter_submit, this is the method your autocompleter_client
    should point at.

=== Additional Customizations ===
Inside the exposed in controller, you can define:

  - autocompleter_append_where_sql_snippet
       Expected to return a conditions array usable by ActiveRecord.

  - autocompleter_append_from_sql_snippet
       Expected to return a from string usable by ActiveRecord.
